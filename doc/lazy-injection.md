# Lazy injection

With PHP-DI all objects that you define in the container are lazily created, i.e. they are created once they are requested or injected somewhere. However that is sometimes not "lazy" enough and you would like the objects to be created only when they are actually used (e.g. when we call a method on them). This is what this section is about.

Please understand that this is an advanced use case and that, unless you are certain of what you are doing, you probably don't need to use this technique.

Consider the following example:

```php
<?php
class Foo
{
    private $a;
    private $b;

    public function __construct(Foo $a, Bar $b)
    {
        $this->a = $a;
        $this->b = $b;
    }

    public function doSomething()
    {
        $this->a->doStuff();
    }

    public function doSomethingElse()
    {
        $this->b->doStuff();
    }
}
```

`a` is used only when `doSomething()` is called, and `b` only when `doSomethingElse()` is called.

You may wonder then: why injecting `a` **and** `b` if they may not be used? Especially if creating those objects is heavy in time or memory.

That's where lazy injection can help.

## How it works

If you define an object as "lazy", PHP-DI will inject:

- the object, if it has already been created
- or else a **proxy** to the object, if it is not yet created

The proxy is a special kind of object that **looks and behaves exactly like the original object**, so you can't tell the difference. The proxy will instantiate the original object only when needed.

Creating a proxy is complex. For this, PHP-DI relies on [ProxyManager](https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager), the (amazing) library used by Doctrine, Symfony and Zend.

### Example

For the simplicity of the example, we will not inject a lazy object, but we will ask the container to return one:

```php
class Foo
{
    public function doSomething()
    {
    }
}

$container->set('Foo', \DI\create()->lazy());

// $proxy is a Proxy object, it is not initialized
// It is very lightweight in memory
$proxy = $container->get('Foo');

var_dump($proxy instanceof Foo); // true

// Calling a method on the proxy will initialize it
$proxy->doSomething();
// Now the proxy is initialized, the real instance of Foo has been created and called
```

## How to use

You can define an object as "lazy". If it is injected as a dependency, then a proxy will be injected instead.

### Installation

Lazy injection requires the [Ocramius/ProxyManager](https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager) library. This library is not installed by default with PHP-DI, you need to require it in your `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php-di/php-di": "*",
        "ocramius/proxy-manager": "~2.0"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer update`.

### Annotations

```php
/**
 * @Injectable(lazy=true)
 */
class MyClass
{
}
```

### PHP code

```php
<?php
$containerPHP->set('foo', \DI\create('MyClass')->lazy());
```

### PHP configuration file

```php
<?php

return [
    'foo' => DI\create('MyClass')
        ->lazy(),
];
```
